# Disney Delights

## Introduction
Welcome to Magic Kingdom! This project is a comprehensive platform dedicated to providing in-depth and honest reviews of Disneyland resorts, specifically focusing on Hong Kong Disneyland, Disneyland Resort in California, and Disneyland Paris. As a passionate Disney enthusiast and collector of Duffy Friends toys, I've created this project to help fellow Disney lovers plan their magical adventures with confidence.

### Why This Porject?
Disneyland is a place where dreams come true, and each resort offers unique experiences and attractions. However, planning a trip can be overwhelming with so many options to consider. Disney Delights aims to simplify this process by offering detailed reviews, ratings, and tips from a true Disney fan's perspective.

## Features
- **User Ratings and Comments:** Allow users to rate their experiences and leave comments, creating a community of Disney enthusiasts sharing their insights.
- **Search and Filter:** Easily find reviews based on specific criteria such as resort, year, and rating.
- **Duffy Friends Collection:** A dedicated section showcasing my collection of Duffy Friends toys, with stories and photos.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains 42,000 reviews of 3 Disneyland branches: Hong Kong Disneyland, Disneyland Resort in California, and Disneyland Paris.

## Example Reviews
**Hong Kong Disneyland**
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Reviewer Location:** United States
- **Review:** Disneyland never cease to amaze me! I've been to Disneyland florida and I thought I have exhausted the kid in me but nope! I still had so much fun in disneyland hong kong. 2 DL off my bucketlist and more to come!    

**Disneyland in California**
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Reviewer Location:** Australia
- **Review:** Disneyland has changed from my last visit in 1990 but  It is still the happiest place on earth. Our children and grandchildren loved it. We spent four magical days there and loved every minute

**Disneyland Paris**
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Reviewer Location:** UK
- **Review:** We have always been a die hard Disney family, so in recent years it was a shame that things started to look run down. However, the most recent refurbishments have been a great success and have brought life back into some of the previously tired attractions. I do miss Disney Dreams, but the new show Illuminations is brilliant and very clever in a different way, focusing more on the laser lighting than fireworks. The new parade is also great and feels more modern. I could write endless reviews on other aspects or tips for the parks, but having just renewed ours I will say that it's always worth looking at the value of annual passes. Typically if you are going to spend more than 3 days in the parks, and think that you might return again within a year, the Magic Plus pass suddenly becomes great value if you can afford the upfront outlay, and you earn back discounts on food and merchandise at 10% from your first trip which will help pay for it. Add in free luggage storage to make weekend trips easier, plus a separate turnstile into the parks, and for us it's a worthwhile upgrade.
